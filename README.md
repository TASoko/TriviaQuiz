# TriviaQuiz
This week's homework was about creating a trivia game about javascript fundamentals. 
The premise of the game is that once a player presses the start button a time counts down. The user then has 60 seconds to answer the questions. 
Each wrong answer will result in a 10 second deduction. The game will end once the timer reaches 0.
